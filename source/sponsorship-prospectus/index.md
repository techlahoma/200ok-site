200 OK brings **200 web professionals** together for a day full of talks covering the full stack of modern web development. We emphasize **open standard web topics** in front-end, back-end, mobile, design, security, privacy, database, and devops technologies.

Before the main event, we host a speakers' dinner, where speakers can network with sponsors, organizers, and local tech community leaders.

The main event is typically fast-paced and highly engaging - we have 5 full-length (40m) talks, and a slot of 7x5-minute lightning talks.

After the main event, we provide tickets for attendees to nearby restaurants to facilitate organic networking and geekery.

Our sponsors help us provide this high-quality conference for professionals in our region while keeping our ticket prices accessible to a wide audience.
