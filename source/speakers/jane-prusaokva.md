bio: "I am a software architect and developer, an Agile proponent, and a great believer in building valuable software that users will love to use. I build large back-end systems that require high-performance and high-reliability, and process vast amounts of data.
I believe that successful software is created by strong teams, requires good engineering practices, and evolves in close collaboration with the users. As a Principal Consultant for Improving Enterprises, I work with distributed teams on distributed software. As a consulting team, we focus on technical excellence, close contact with the client, and rapid iterations."

Computers and the Internet-Of-Things generate data about our every move, passing thought or feeling. There is also a comprehensive set of data on our life’s context: our whereabouts, connections, physiological state, patterns of movement, and deeply ingrained subconscious behaviors.

While that information may not be immediately visible or easy to learn from, it is created, collected and saved. Over time, the pile of data grows. The processing technologies become more sophisticated and powerful. The data that was originally "anonymous" becomes easily identifiable. And no data is ever “forgotten”.

In this session we will consider what data is being collected, the implications of cross-processing streams of data from different sources, and the power of metadata. There are no more secrets.

Inspired by “Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World” by Bruce Schneier
