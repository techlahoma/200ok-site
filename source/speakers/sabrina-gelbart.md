So you've built an awesome app. You might even have Google Analytics installed to get a broad view of what's happening. But what do you do if you need to track users individually for support or other purposes? What if you need to track history of one of your models, like a post or task or product? This lightening talk will go over EVENT DATA aka what is happening on your app over time and give you a quick overview of ways we've explored for tracking it. We'll give you a quick overview of some external and internal solutions in addition to some quick and dirty possibilities for implementation.
