The web development world is moving extremely fast. A lot of it can be attributed to the open source community. Your job/company environment can either help keep you with the momentum or slow you down. Not being able to keep up with the rapid pace could have the potential of making your skills less relevant and put your career at risk.

In this talk, I will explain why contributing to open source is the answer to helping you keep up with rapidly evolving web world and what everyone can hope to achieve if all developers contributed to open source.
