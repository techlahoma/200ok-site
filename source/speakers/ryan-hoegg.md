bio: "I have always sought out opportunities to learn outside my comfort zone, be it in systems administration, networking, enterprise architecture, performance tuning or functional programming. I contribute to open source software, recruit teams, set up DevOps stacks, design REST APIs, and teach agile techniques. I lean towards agile and lean thinking, REST APIs, empiricism, dynamic languages, NoSQL data solutions, open source, Theory Y management, and spare documentation."

Continuous delivery is a central theme in the DevOps movement, and certainly a central component of the culture. It is the set of engineering techniques, practices, processes, and tools for releasing changes to software services frequently and reliably.

We’ll review the concepts involved in CD, take a look a working CD pipeline for an example application, and discuss how this could apply to other projects.
